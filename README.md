# 🐶 PetShop System
Hi! I'm Dom Henrique, a full-stack developer!
I recently started my journey in Computer Science, and one of the projects I was able to participate in was the creation of a pet shop system - something basic, done in the terminal in Python.
However, I thought: why not create something more sophisticated?
So, following the principle of using Python, I implemented the Flask framework with the SQLAlchemy API and Flask Login to create a web application based on e-commerce.

# "How is the project divided?"
The system's home page is the login screen, with email and password fields. If the user has not been registered, the user must go to the registration screen, which collects first and last name, email, password, username, and user type.
Note: this last functionality will undergo further processing. For now, we will leave it as is for a complete user experience.

# "How do I clone this project?"
Go to your terminal in your preferred IDE and type:
```
git clone https://github.com/Dom-Henrique/PetShop-System.git
```
The folders will be generated and you can enjoy the project prototype!

# Future Features
We intend to add the following functions to the project:
- Accessibility for visually impaired users;
- Facial recognition;
- Animations;

Thank you for using my project for your studies. Feel free to give your feedback. Opinions are always welcome!
